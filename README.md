Software Test Automation & QA

// How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? \\
I think a great way to ensure this is to implement proper JUnit tests that can automate and perform tests to make sure that the requirements for a particular project are met. This also ensures that the code is secure by providing some input validation to the program like in the case of the project in this course.

// How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? \\
A good method to interpreting user needs is to thoroughly read the goals of a client or project and make a list identify each individual requirement for each object withihn the project. From there, they can be incorporated into the program by implementing them one at a time and testing them individually with the use of a JUnit tests. I think testing one requirement at a time lets you not get too far ahead and miss potential requirements.

// How do I approach designing software? \\
I think my approach remains the same since starting my degree program. Read the document introducing the client and first interpret their goals and what they want their product to do. From there, inspect each aspect of what can make that happen and get a list of objects within the project. Lastly, make a list of each requirement for the respective object and start getting an outline for the project as a whole with all of the pertinent information now recieved.
